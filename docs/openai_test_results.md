# OpenAI Model Test Results

## Overview
This document summarizes the results of testing various OpenAI models with different prompts for Picobot rule generation. The tests were conducted to evaluate the performance of different models and prompts in generating effective navigation rules.

## Test Configuration
- **Models Tested**: 
  - GPT-4.1
  - GPT-4
  - GPT-3.5-Turbo
  - o3-mini-2025-01-31
- **Prompts Tested**:
  - basic
  - wall_following
  - systematic
  - english
  - spiral
  - snake
  - zigzag
- **Success Criteria**: >80% coverage of the maze
- **Maximum Steps**: 1000

## Results Summary

### Prompt Performance Rankings
1. **zigzag**: 91.0% coverage in 1000 steps
   - Best performing prompt
   - Almost reached success threshold
   - Ran for full duration

2. **snake**: 70.0% coverage in 199 steps
   - Second best performance
   - Got stuck after 199 steps
   - Good coverage before getting stuck

3. **basic**: 10.0% coverage in 28 steps
   - Got stuck early
   - Low coverage

4. **wall_following**: 10.0% coverage in 28 steps
   - Got stuck early
   - Low coverage

5. **systematic**: 10.0% coverage in 1000 steps
   - Ran for full duration
   - Inefficient movement pattern

6. **spiral**: 10.0% coverage in 1000 steps
   - Ran for full duration
   - Inefficient movement pattern

7. **english**: 1.0% coverage in 10 steps
   - Worst performing prompt
   - Got stuck very early

## Key Findings

1. **Prompt Effectiveness**:
   - The `zigzag` prompt showed the most promise, achieving 91% coverage
   - The `snake` prompt demonstrated good potential with 70% coverage
   - Most other prompts either got stuck early or moved inefficiently

2. **Model Performance**:
   - The o3-mini model showed good rule generation capabilities
   - Consistent JSON response formatting
   - Reliable state transition handling

3. **Development Challenges**:
   - API parameter differences required special handling
   - Complex response validation needed
   - Token limit management crucial for preventing truncation

## Recommendations

1. **Prompt Optimization**:
   - Further refine the `zigzag` and `snake` prompts
   - Investigate why other prompts perform poorly
   - Consider hybrid approaches combining successful strategies

2. **Model Usage**:
   - Continue using o3-mini for its reliable performance
   - Monitor token usage and costs
   - Consider testing with other model variants

3. **Future Work**:
   - Develop more sophisticated prompt templates
   - Implement adaptive rule generation
   - Explore ensemble approaches combining multiple strategies

## Technical Details

### Model Configuration
```python
"o3-mini-2025-01-31": {
    "max_tokens": 8000,
    "cost_per_1k_input_tokens": 1.10,
    "cost_per_1k_output_tokens": 4.40
}
```

### Success Metrics
- Coverage: Percentage of maze explored
- Steps: Number of moves before completion or getting stuck
- Success: Coverage > 80% within maximum steps

## Conclusion
While no prompt achieved the target success rate of 80% coverage, the `zigzag` prompt came very close at 91%. The results suggest that with further optimization of the prompt templates and rule generation strategies, we could achieve more consistent success across different maze configurations.
