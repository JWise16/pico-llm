"""English language prompt for Picobot rule generation."""

ENGLISH_PROMPT = """Generate a complete set of Picobot rules that will allow the robot to visit every cell in its environment.

The rules must follow this EXACT format:
STATE PATTERN -> MOVE NEXT_STATE

Where:
- STATE is a number from 0 to 4
- PATTERN is a 4-character string representing walls (N, S, E, W) or no walls (x)
- MOVE is one of: N, S, E, W
- NEXT_STATE is a number from 0 to 4

PATTERN FORMAT:
- The pattern must be exactly 4 characters long
- Use N, S, E, W for walls in those directions
- Use x for no wall in that direction
- NO SPACES in the pattern
- NO WILDCARDS (*)

VALID PATTERN EXAMPLES:
xxxx (no walls)
Nxxx (wall to north)
xExx (wall to east)
xxWx (wall to west)
xxxS (wall to south)
NExx (walls to north and east)
xxWS (walls to west and south)

INVALID PATTERN EXAMPLES:
* * * * (has spaces)
N*** (uses wildcards)
N x x x (has spaces)
N*W* (uses wildcards)

IMPORTANT: You MUST generate rules for ALL of these patterns for EACH state:
- xxxx (no walls)
- Nxxx (wall to north)
- NExx (walls to north and east)
- NxWx (walls to north and west)
- xxxS (wall to south)
- xExS (walls to east and south)
- xxWS (walls to west and south)
- xExx (wall to east)
- xxWx (wall to west)

Generate a complete set of rules that:
- go north until you hit a boundary
- enter a new state that takes us west until we hit a west boundary
- enter a new state that moves us south until we hit a south boundary
- then move east one step now enter a new state that takes us north to the north boundary - when we hit the north boundary, then move east one step, and then move to the south bondary, move east one step, and then repeat the north south sweeping process with one move east inbetween each time
- repeat this north south sweeping process until we fill the whole room

Respond with a JSON object containing a "rules" array, where each rule has:
- state: number (0-4)
- pattern: string (4 chars, NSEWx)
- move: string (N, E, W, S)
- next_state: number (0-4)"""
