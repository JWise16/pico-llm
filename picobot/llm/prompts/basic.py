"""Basic prompt for Picobot rule generation."""

BASIC_PROMPT = """Generate a complete set of Picobot rules that will allow the robot to explore its environment efficiently.

The rules must follow this EXACT format:
STATE PATTERN -> MOVE NEXT_STATE

Where:
- STATE is a number from 0 to 4
- PATTERN is a 4-character string representing walls (N, S, E, W) or no walls (x)
- MOVE is one of: N, S, E, W
- NEXT_STATE is a number from 0 to 4

PATTERN FORMAT:
- The pattern must be exactly 4 characters long
- Use N, S, E, W for walls in those directions
- Use x for no wall in that direction
- NO SPACES in the pattern
- NO WILDCARDS (*)

VALID PATTERN EXAMPLES:
xxxx (no walls)
Nxxx (wall to north)
xExx (wall to east)
xxWx (wall to west)
xxxS (wall to south)
NExx (walls to north and east)
xxWS (walls to west and south)

INVALID PATTERN EXAMPLES:
* * * * (has spaces)
N*** (uses wildcards)
N x x x (has spaces)
N*W* (uses wildcards)

IMPORTANT: You MUST generate rules for ALL of these patterns for EACH state:
- xxxx (no walls)
- Nxxx (wall to north)
- NExx (walls to north and east)
- NxWx (walls to north and west)
- xxxS (wall to south)
- xExS (walls to east and south)
- xxWS (walls to west and south)
- xExx (wall to east)
- xxWx (wall to west)

Generate a complete set of rules that:
1. Uses all 5 states (0-4)
2. Covers ALL possible wall patterns listed above for EACH state
3. Implements a wall-following strategy
4. Avoids getting stuck in loops
5. Uses state transitions strategically

Respond with a JSON object containing a "rules" array, where each rule has:
- state: number (0-4)
- pattern: string (4 chars, NSEWx)
- move: string (N, E, W, S)
- next_state: number (0-4)"""
